## Contributions of each member

#### THIRUPATHI REDDY PARSHURAMGARI 

* Set up the project.

* Fixed minor issues (typos, etc.) to get the project to compile.

* Started working on the job and process scheduling code.

* Started implementing code that prints the current status of the simulation (`writeStatus()` method).

* Implemented code that handles **'A'** (new job), **'D'** (display status), **'E'** (time quantum expiration) and **'T'** (job termination) events.

* ***Time spent working: Approximately  days.***
#### SAIKIRAN REDDY NAGULAPALLY 

* Continued working on the implementation of the `writeStatus()` method. Added code that displays the current job scheduling and ready queues.

* Added code that displays the I/O and finished queues, and semaphores.

* Added code that computes and prints average turnout and job scheduling wait times (not considering I/O or semaphores).

* Added code that prints the total memory available in the system.

* Implemented code that handles I/O operations (**'I'** and **'C'** events).

* Modified the writeStatus() method to print the current status of the I/O wait queue.

* Modified time average turnout and job scheduling wait time calculating methods to make sure numbers are formatted properly.

* ***Time spent working: Approximately  days.***

#### SINDHU THANDRA

* Implemented semaphore-related code (acquiring, releasing, queueing, signaling, etc).

* Implemented **'W'** (wait on a semaphore) and **'S'** (signal on a semaphore) events.

* Cleaned up the code (refactored/restructured stuff, wrote additional comments, etc).

* Modified the code so that output is printed to files, rather than standard output (stdout).

* ***Time spent working: Approximately  days.***
